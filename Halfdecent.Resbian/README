x.  Introduction

    Resbian is a command-line tool for performing tasks related to
    localisable embedded resources.  Currently it only peforms one kind
    of task.

    "compile"

        The "compile" subcommand collects localised assets in source
        form -- text files, image files, etc. -- and compiles them into
        a special binary file format suitable for embedding into .NET
        assemblies.  In other words, it's a replacement for the .NET
        "resgen" program that works directly from source assets instead
        of .resx files.
