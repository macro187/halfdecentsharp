x.  Introduction

    Halfdecent Sharp is a suite of tools and libraries for .NET software
    development.  The tools aim to be small, task-specific, cross-platform,
    and suited for use from the command line and scripts.  The libraries aim
    to improve on - and in some cases replace - those in the base class
    library.


x.  Tools

    -   Resbian, an embedded resource compiler
    -   Traitor, a C# source code preprocessor implementing simple traits
        (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_%28computer_science%29)
    -   Permuda, a C# source code preprocessor that generates permutations
        of templated code
